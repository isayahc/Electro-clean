# Project Temp Name

## Objective
Use rapidly produced bodies noted as $\mathcal{B}$ of various dimensions, each with charged surfaces surfaces of variable charges in {unit of measurement for static charge} to collect pollutants ranging from:
- PM10
- PM2.5
- PM0.1

Additional this device could locate and collect bulk pollutants with the maximum mass $\mathrm{M_{bulk}}$, measured in grams.

## Properties of $\mathcal{B}$
as well as bulk material of mass $\mathrm{M_{bulk}}$. Each $\mathcal{B}$ will be produced by using a chemical compound denoted as $\mathcal{C}$.  $\mathcal{C}$ will optimize:
- the life time of each $\mathcal{B}$
- the mechanical integrity of $\mathcal{B}$

Other aditional features of a $\mathcal{B}$ include:

- the ability to transfer information to other $\mathcal{B}$'s, and if close enough, to center node (Probably controlled by microcontrolled, but will depend on the computing power needed)
- the ability to convert Electro-Magnetic energy into sound / read Electro-Magnetic energy from $\mathrm{Area_{read}}^3$. Also must be able to handle noise from data.
- Must be able to store charge ranging from $\mathrm{Charge_{max}}$ to $\mathrm{Charge_{min}}$
- Has the ability to locate clusters of polluntants, as well as location bulk material 

### Charges
$\mathcal{B}$ can become charged via an [electrostatic generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostatic_generator) such as  [Van de Graaff generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_de_Graaff_generator) a which uses a moving belt to accumulate electric charge on a hollow metal globe on the top of an insulated column, creating very high electric potentials. A battery powered Van de Graff generator can be built with instructions in this [video](https://youtu.be/b-Gs81_-_aU). A Van de Graff will attract the bubbles as seen [here](https://youtu.be/hoswNJZqUX0). The bubbles will takes electrons from the Van de Graff, so it is important to have an estimation of where the charges are. Due to to excess charge, $\mathcal{B}$ will atract particles of lesser charge based on Columb's law, which states that like charges repel and opposite charges attract.
