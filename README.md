# Project ElectroClean

## Objective
Design and create a system that utilizes rapidly produced bodies, denoted as $\mathcal{B}$, with charged surfaces to collect fine particulate matter (PM10, PM2.5, and PM0.1) and bulk pollutants with a maximum mass of $\mathrm{M_{bulk}}$, measured in grams.

## Properties of $\mathcal{B}$

Each member of $\mathcal{B}$, denoted $b_i$ will be produced using a chemical compound denoted as $\mathcal{C}$. $\mathcal{C}$ will optimize:
- The lifetime of $b_i$
- The mechanical integrity of $b_i$

Additional features of $b_i$ include:

- The ability to transfer information to other $b_i$ units and, if close enough, to a central node (likely controlled by a microcontroller, but this will depend on the required computing power)
- The ability to convert electromagnetic energy into sound and read electromagnetic energy from $\mathrm{Area_{read}}^3$. The system must also be able to handle noise from data.
- The capacity to store charges ranging from $\mathrm{Charge_{max}}$ to $\mathrm{Charge_{min}}$
- The capability to locate clusters of pollutants and identify the location of bulk materials

### Charging

Based on a demostration in [This Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoswNJZqUX0). $\mathcal{B}$ can be charged using an [electrostatic generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostatic_generator) such as a [Van de Graaff generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_de_Graaff_generator), which uses a moving belt to accumulate electric charge on a hollow metal globe on top of an insulated column, creating very high electric potentials. The charged $b_i$ units will attract particles with lesser charges based on Coulomb's law, which states that like charges repel and opposite charges attract.

## Potential Applications

The Project ElectroClean system can be applied in various sectors and industries, such as:

- Air purification in urban areas, reducing air pollution and improving public health
- Industrial applications, to reduce emissions and minimize the environmental impact of manufacturing processes
- Indoor air quality management, for homes, offices, and other enclosed spaces, leading to a healthier indoor environment


## Future Work and Considerations

Further research and development of the Project ElectroClean system should focus on:

1. Identifying and optimizing the chemical compound ($\mathcal{C}$) for producing $\mathcal{B}$ units with desired properties, such as longer lifetimes and improved mechanical integrity.
2. Developing an efficient charging mechanism for $b_i$ units that allows for precise control of the charge distribution and minimizes energy consumption.
3. Investigating the most effective communication and data transfer methods between $\mathcal{B}$ units and the central node, ensuring robustness, and real-time monitoring capabilities.
4. Enhancing the electromagnetic energy conversion and noise handling capabilities of the system to improve the accuracy and efficiency of pollutant detection and collection.
5. Exploring methods for disposing of or recycling the collected particulate matter and bulk pollutants, to ensure a closed-loop and environmentally sustainable process.
6. Conducting tests and simulations to validate the effectiveness of the system under various environmental conditions and pollutant concentrations.
7. Evaluating the cost-effectiveness and scalability of the system for large-scale deployment in different contexts, such as urban areas, industrial settings, or indoor environments.

By addressing these challenges and optimizing the various aspects of the Project ElectroClean system, this innovative approach to pollution management has the potential to make a significant impact
